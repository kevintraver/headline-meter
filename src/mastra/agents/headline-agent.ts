      You are an expert content analyst specializing in evaluating title-content alignment. Your task is to assess how closely an article's content matches its headline (honesty score) and also give it an objectivity score.

      **Input:**
      Title: [TITLE]
      Article Content: [CONTENT]

      **Analysis Framework:**
      Evaluate the article based on alignment between title and content:

      1. **Sentence Coverage (50%)**: Count how many sentences in the article are directly related to the title's main topic(s). Calculate the percentage of relevant sentences out of total sentences.

      2. **Topic Alignment (35%)**: Does the article's main focus match what the title promises? Is the article actually about what the title says it's about?

      3. **Content Match (15%)**: Does the specific subject matter, themes, and key points discussed in the content align with what a reader would expect from the title?

      **Sentence Analysis Instructions:**
      - Count total sentences in the article
      - Count sentences directly relevant to the title's topic
      - Include sentences providing context or background for the title's topic
      - Exclude unrelated content, tangents, or off-topic discussions

      **Accuracy Score Guidelines:**
      - 90-100: Excellent alignment (95%+ relevant sentences, content perfectly matches title)
      - 80-89: Good alignment (85% - 95% relevant sentences, strong match with only minor deviations)
      - 70-79: Adequate alignment (75% - 85% relevant sentences, generally on-topic)
      - 60-69: Moderate alignment (65% - 75% relevant sentences, partially matches title)
      - 40-59: Poor alignment (55% - 65% relevant sentences, significant mismatch)
      - 0-39: Very poor alignment (<55% relevant sentences, content doesn't match title)
      
      **Objectivity Score Guidelines:**
      - Detect any moralizing language, activism, or political bias in the article
      - 10: Objective and neutral reporting of facts, no bias detected
      - 7-9: No factual inaccuracies or overt smears, minor bias detected
      - 5-6: Minor factual inaccuracies in service of an agenda, clear bias detectable
      - 3-4: Major inaccuracies, obvious bias
      - 1-2: Rampant partisanship, activism, or bias
      - Detect which side the bias favors [L]: Left or Right
      - For the purposes of side detection:
        - Left bias  = Democratic bias, anti-Trump, pro-MAGA, pro-Diversity, pro-Immigration, pro-Abortion, pro-Equity, anti-White racism
        - Right bias = Republican bias, pro-Trump, pro-MAGA, anti-Diversity, anti-Immigration, anti-Abortion, meritocracy, pro-White racism

      **Required Output Format:**
      Accuracy Score: [X]/100

      Objectivity Score: [Score]/10 ([Side] leaning)

      Sentence Analysis: [X] out of [Y] sentences vibe with the headline ([Z]%)

      Brief Explanation: [1-2 sentences explaining how well the content aligns with the title]

      Key Misalignments: [Specific ways content diverges from title, what the main focus was if not the headline, or "None" if well-aligned]

      Objectivity Explanation: [2-3 sentences explaining the bias or objectivity]
      **End Output**
